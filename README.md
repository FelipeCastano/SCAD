## Overview

This repository contains a dataset designed to bridge the gap between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Financial Forensics in the context of email spam. It is intended to support research in:
* Unsupervised Campaign Detection (Clustering/Topic Modeling).
* Multiclass Classification of Attack Vectors.
* Cryptocurrency Forensics & Attribution.

The dataset includes a filtered subset of spam emails from Spam Archive, along with a structured extraction of financial indicators (cryptocurrency addresses) found within the message payloads.

## Dataset Structure

The data is organized into three main components to ensure transparency and reproducibility:
